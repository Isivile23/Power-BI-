### Describe using Power BI to build data-driven analytics


Businesses have a lot of data but struggle to understand it. Power BI is a Microsoft tool that helps turn complex data into easy-to-understand visuals and reports. It allows you to connect to various data sources, clean and analyze the data, and then share it with others. Power BI comes in three versions: a desktop application, an online service, and mobile apps.

#### Capacities

Businesses have a lot of data but struggle to understand it. Power BI is a Microsoft tool that helps turn complex data into easy-to-understand visuals and reports. It allows you to connect to various data sources, clean and analyze the data, and then share it with others. Power BI comes in three versions: a desktop application, an online service, and mobile apps.

#### Workspaces

Power BI uses workspaces to organize reports, dashboards, and data. There are two main types:

* My Workspace: This is your personal space for creating and working on your own reports and dashboards.
* Workspaces: These are for collaboration. You can invite colleagues to work together on reports, dashboards, and even create shareable apps (collections of reports and dashboards) for others in your organization. Unlike "My Workspace," most users in a collaborative workspace need a Power BI Pro license.

#### Semantic models

In Power BI, a semantic model is like a central hub for your data. It can connect to and import information from various sources, including Excel files, cloud databases, and even other semantic models.  These models are linked to workspaces, allowing you and your colleagues (with the right permissions) to access and share the data in reports and dashboards.

#### Shared semantic models

Sharing well-defined "semantic models" is crucial for good business intelligence with Power BI. These models act as a single, reliable source of truth for your data, created by experts and reusable by report builders. This ensures consistency and accuracy in reports and data-driven decision making throughout your organization. When creating reports in Power BI, simply choose "Power BI semantic models" to leverage these shared models.

#### Reports

Power BI reports are collections of visualizations (charts, maps, etc.) built from datasets. You can create them from scratch, import them, or have Power BI generate them when connecting to data sources.  There are two ways to interact with reports:

* Reading view (default): This is for viewing and exploring the report.
* Editing view (requires permission): This allows modifying the report's layout and visualizations.
  
Reports are listed under the Reports tab in a workspace and can be opened from there.  Within apps (collections of reports and dashboards), you can access reports by clicking on dashboard tiles linked to those reports.

#### Dashboards

In Power BI, a dashboard is a single screen that brings together important information from reports and Q&A. It displays these insights as tiles or widgets, allowing you to:

* See everything you need to make a decision at a glance.
* Monitor key business metrics.
* Ensure everyone in your team is on the same page with the same data.
* Track the health of various aspects of your business.
* Create personalized views of dashboards focused on what matters to you.

Dashboards are listed under the Dashboards tab in a workspace and can be opened directly. Within apps (collections of reports and dashboards), the dashboard is the first thing you see. You can also access reports from the dashboard by clicking on linked tiles.  Depending on how the dashboard was shared with you, you may have viewing or editing permissions.

#### Tempelate Apps

Power BI template apps are pre-built analytics tools for Power BI. They are designed by Power BI partners and allow for easy customization by the end user. This lets businesses leverage the expertise of these partners without extensive coding, and ultimately understand their data better.

### Describe cleaning and transforming data in Power BI Desktop

Working with data from multiple sources often requires cleaning and transformation before it can be analyzed together.

* Data might be in different formats or have unnecessary details.

* Power BI Desktop helps clean and transform data for analysis.

It has three views:

  * Report view: Build and arrange visualizations.
  * Data view: See the data structure and make changes.
  * Model view: Manage relationships between different data sets.
    
Power Query Editor within Power BI Desktop helps reshape and transform the data for better use in reports and visualizations.
